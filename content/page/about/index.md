## About me
I am a software development fresher and a third-year student. I study [Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)](https://www.hcmut.edu.vn/en) so I know much fundamental knowledge about software development in general, but in practice, I have only done projects at university. Recently, I am joining the [fresher program of VNG](https://career.vng.com.vn/danh-cho-sinh-vien/vng-tech-fresher-2022), which provides me more opportunities to explore and exploit more about the software development industry. I am trying to learn more things, to be better than myself everyday.
## About this site
This site is created as a coursework of a training program in VNG of me. But that is just a reason for the starting of the site, it cannot imply anything. Maybe, in the future, I will share more knowledge that I would have learnt, or sometimes I will just write a brief thinking of a book. But in general, this site is expected to always contain some information about me and my experience.

I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to create this site. The template I am using have some helpful posts about Hugo (for those who want to use it to create a site like me) or [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (if you are an active writer and still do not know about it, trust me you will love it). I will keep these posts present (another reason is the current emptyness of the site).
